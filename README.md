# ðŸ’§ Unlit Campfires ðŸ’§

I was always annoyed when using mods like [Campfire Fix](https://modrinth.com/mod/campfire-fix) because you still place them with a fire texture but it ends up unlit... very unsettling right? That was enough for me to make this resourcepack.

This resourcepack also makes Soul Campfires have Soul Soil instead of ashes for better consistency. Thank me later. (Soul Campfires was added in 1.16x)
